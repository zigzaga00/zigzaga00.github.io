Welcome to the **Sisters in2 Tech** aka **sin(2) tech** ✨  
We’re an unapologetic **girls-only computing & technology club** for ages **7 to 17**.  
Think of us as a safe, relaxed, and welcoming space where girls can **explore, create, and have fun** in tech. 🌟

## 💗 Why We Exist

We’re here because the tech world - and society at large - still sends the wrong message to girls: that they _don’t belong_ in computing.

This isn’t about ability - [girls consistently outperform boys in computing](https://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/wise-gcse-results-2024/) - it’s about **societal and cultural barriers** that chip away at confidence and push talented minds away from tech.

That's not a missed opportnunity - it's an **injustice that must be put right.**

So our mission is simple:

- **Build confidence** 💕
- **Nurture self-belief** 🌸
- **Grow self-efficacy** 🌼
- **Have fun!** 🎉

## 🎀 What We Do

We keep things **fun, creative, and community-focused**.
This means we learn with **hands on** and **imaginative projects** in a **supportive space**.

On our website, you’ll find:

- **Project walkthroughs** — step-by-step guides to help you make amazing things quickly and give you a real sense of achievement. 🎨
- **Practical technique cards** — little bursts of skill power. 💡
- **Project idea cards** — so you’ll never run out of inspiration. 🌈
- **Deep dive computer science cards** — for if you want to explore the magic behind the code. ✨
- **Instructional videos** — learn your way, at your own pace. 🎬
- **Cyber security games** — join our fictional agency **The Shadow Net Agency** and try ethical hacking in a safe, story-driven way. 🕵️‍♀️
