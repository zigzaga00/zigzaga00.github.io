# 🌟 Zig-Zag Cyber-Lab

Welcome to the **Zig-Zag Cyber-Lab** — an experimental, child-centered space for creative computing, discovery, and impact.

This project is grounded in the belief that **all children**—especially **girls**—deserve the chance to thrive in computing and understand how tech can be used to make the world better. Our lab is a learning environment rooted in the educational philosophies of **Rogoff**, **Montessori**, **Papert**, **Bruner**, **Vygotsky**, and inspired visionaries like **Grace Hopper** and **Alan Kay**.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Zig-Zag Cyber-Lab is designed to:

* **Foster a love of computing** through real-world, purpose-driven projects which children can get passionate about.
* **Empower children** to take the lead in their learning, using pull-down technique cards and collaborative deep dives as and when they need them | we follow no linear model of progress here | we zig and zag between areas of learning with Bruner's core concept at heart "Any subject can be taught effectively in some intellectualy honest form to any child at any stage of development." *Jerome Bruner - The Process of Education*.
* **Break gender barriers** by building confidence, creativity, and belonging in tech for girls.
* **Encourage social learning** and project-based discovery that is meaningful and community-focused.
* **Inspire change**, showing how computing can solve problems, tell stories, protect nature, support wellbeing, and much more!

## 💡 What You'll Find

This site shares:

* 🎓 **Practical Technique Cards** – Short, accessible guides to help children learn just-in-time skills (Video links are coming...) :smiley:
* 🔍 **Deep Dive Cards** – For exploring the computer science behind the techniques | not essential for success but of interest to some learners
* 🌍 **Project Cards** – Real-world and fun project ideas that encourage creativity and action | projects for children to build from and develop in their own way
* 🧠 **Pedagogical Heritage** – The powerful ideas that shape our approach to learning
* 🔐 **Ethical Hacking** – Children learn offensive “red team” cybersecurity skills by immersing themselves in a fictional world of espionage (by joining the Shadow Net Agency), gaining hands-on experience through Capture The Flag (CTF) style missions that build practical skills and awareness of cyber security

## ✨ Ethos

We believe:

- 🌈 “The computer is simply an instrument whose music is ideas.” – *Alan Kay*
- ❄️ Education should nurture “the peculiar bent of the genius of each child.” – *Paraphrased from Plato*
- 👧🏼 "Computing is too important to be left to men." - *Karen Sparck Jones*
